This documentation presents the :ref:`Banner <structure/banner>` and :ref:`Masonry
<structure/masonry>` building blocks.

Banner block
------------

The :guilabel:`Banner` block combines a title, text, images, and a call to action, making it
suitable for placement at the top of your website.

A default background image and content are displayed when adding the :guilabel:`Banner` block onto
your web page. They can be edited by going to the :guilabel:`Customize` tab in the website
configurator.

Call to action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Call to Action` button encourages visitors to take a specific action, for example, to
consult your shop, download your eBook, or make an appointment in order to boost your sales.
